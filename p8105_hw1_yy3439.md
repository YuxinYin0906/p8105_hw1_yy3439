## Problem 1: Load the `early_january_weather` dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")   #load the required dataset
```

## Description

The dataset `early_january_weather` has 15 variables: `origin`, `year`,
`month`, `day`, `hour`, `temp`, `dewp`, `humid`, `wind_dir`,
`wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `precip`, `pressure`, `visib`, and
`time_hour`. There are 13 numeric variables, 1 character variable, and 1
POSIXct variable. This dataset contains 358 rows and 15 columns. The
mean temperature is 39.5821229 .

## Scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(data = early_january_weather, #create a scatterplot using ggplot
       aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()   #add color 
```

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot.pdf") #use ggsave() to save the plot in PDF form
```

## Problem 2

``` r
mydata_df = tibble(        #create a dataframe consisting 
  samp = rnorm(10),        #random sample of size 10 from normal distribution using rnorm function
  vec_logical = samp > 0,  #a logical varible indicating weather each smaple is greater than 0 
  vec_char = c("apple", "sky", "bananna", "blueberries", "sun", "flag", "sea", "shirt", "cherry", "light"),  
                           #a character variable consisting 10 elements
  vec_factor = factor(c("red", "blue","yellow", "blue", "yellow", "red", "blue", "blue", "red", "red"))
                           #a factor variable consisting of 3 levels: red, blue, and yellow
)
```

## Taking the Mean of Each Variable

``` r
samp_mean <- pull(mydata_df, samp) #pull the "samp" column out of the dataframe and take the mean of it 
mean(samp_mean)
vec_logicalmean <- pull(mydata_df, vec_logical) #pull the "vec_logical" column out of the dataframe and take the mean of it 
mean(vec_logicalmean)
vec_charmean <- pull(mydata_df, vec_char) #pull the "vec_char" column out of the dataframe and take the mean of it 
mean(vec_charmean)
vec_factormean <- pull(mydata_df, vec_factor) #pull the "vec_factor" column out of the dataframe and take the mean of it 
mean(vec_factormean)
```

## Discussion on Taking the Mean of Each Variable

Based on the above code chunk and results, we can see that R can
calculate the mean value of numerical variables and logical variables.
Specifically, when calculating the average of a logical variable, R
would treat “TRUE” as 1 and “FALSE” as 0. Therefore, when taking the
average of a logical variable, we are actually seeing the proportion of
“TRUE” values. However, when trying to take average of the character and
factor variables, R gives the result “Warning: argument is not numeric
ot logical: returning NA\[1\] NA. This indicates that R are only able to
calculate the average of numerical and logical values by default.
Further transformations are required if we are interested in taking the
average of character and factor variables.

\##Transform to Numerical Variables

``` r
as.numeric(vec_logicalmean) #translate logical, character, and factor variables to numerical variables
as.numeric(vec_charmean)
as.numeric(vec_factormean)
```

We can see from the output that the `as.numeric` function successfully
translated the logical variable to “1” and “0”. As a result, it proves
that R treats “TRUE” as “1” and “FALSE” as 0. In addition, it assigned
the three color levels “1”, “2”, and “3”. However, it fails to translate
the character variable to the numeric class, and the error message
“Warning: NAs introduced by coercion” was shown. As a result, we should
be aware that R might not always translate chracter values to meaningful
numerical values.
